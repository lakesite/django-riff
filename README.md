# django-riff #

ðŸŽ¸ A simple Django template. ðŸŽ¸

## motivation ##

We've made decisions in how projects should be structured and setup, 
particularly with settings, and our custom user model.  These decisions are
defined in [django-practices](https://github.com/lakesite/django-practices) and
our django projects should use [django-emailuser](https://github.com/lakesite/django-emailuser)

* django-riff provides a basic template for our django projects.

* Area of focus:
  - Standards.
  - Django projects.

Further [rationale](docs/rationale.md) provided.
